  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and project_state.json, but the actual implementation changes to fix the raw material authentication issue are not visible due to truncation. The project_state.json correctly tracks the feature request, but without seeing the complete backend code changes (specifically the addRawMaterial, updateRawMaterial, and deleteRawMaterial functions), I cannot verify whether REQ-46 was properly implemented.",

The visible code shows verifyAdmin function and other admin-protected functions (addRecipe, setIngredientCost, updateIngredientCost), but the actual raw material CRUD operations mentioned in the requirement are not visible in the provided diff.",
