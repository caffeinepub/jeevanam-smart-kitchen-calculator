  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all requirements for fixing live deployment service unavailability and connection errors. Comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff retry logic has been added across all query hooks, a connection status banner displays service availability prominently, an error boundary catches initialization errors with recovery instructions, and a backend health check endpoint has been implemented. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
