  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive canister stopped error handling and initialization improvements across backend and frontend, covering all three requirements. Backend adds initialization state management and migration support, while frontend implements sophisticated error detection, retry mechanisms, and user guidance for canister stopped scenarios.",

      "description": "Auto-retry mechanism with exponential backoff in Login.tsx",
      "reason": "REQ-3 requests error handling with user guidance but does not specify automatic retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts with increasing delays). The BuildRequest asks for 'user-friendly guidance on next steps' and 'whether to retry or wait', implying manual user action rather than automatic retries.",

      "description": "Migration module for state migration",
      "reason": "No requirement mentions adding state migration capabilities or versioning actor state. The migration.mo file adds infrastructure for migrating old actor state to new state with isInitialized field, which was not requested.",
